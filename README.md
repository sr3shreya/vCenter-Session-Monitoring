# vCenter-Session-Monitoring
Powershell Script to fetch active and idle sessions from vCenter
The Script uses functions from VMware PowerCLI Module, hence powercli must be installed in order to execute the script successfully.
I have attached the script for installing power-cli using zip-file, in case of non-administrative rights.
If you have admin rights, the module can be directly instaled using following command- 
Install-module -name VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser
